## Project overview
RedactAI is a locally running desktop application, which automatically detects and applies redactions to documents (images for now).

## Preferred language version and development tools
Python 3.14
Use `uv` for dependency management and virtual environments.
Use `black` for code formatting.
Use `flake8` for linting.

## How to set up the development environment
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
2. Install dependencies and create the virtual environment:
```bash
uv sync
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
uv shell
```

After development, you can run tests and linting with:
```bash
uv run pytest
uv run flake8 src tests
uv run black --check src tests
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Running checks locally before pushing

Before pushing your branch, run the same checks that CI will run:

```bash
# Install/update dependencies
uv sync

# Lint code
uv run flake8 src tests

# Check formatting
uv run black --check src tests
uv run isort --check-only src tests

# Auto-fix formatting issues
uv run black src tests
uv run isort src tests

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests
```

### Creating a pull request

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of what you changed"
   ```

3. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

4. On GitHub, create a PR to `main`

5. Wait for the CI workflow to complete (usually 2–3 minutes)
   - Check the "Checks" tab on your PR
   - All checks must pass (✅) before merging

6. If checks fail:
   - Read the error logs
   - Fix issues locally
   - Commit and push again
   - CI will re-run automatically

7. Once all checks pass, merge your PR

### Creating a release

When you're ready to release a version:

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and everything is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a version tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The CI/CD system will automatically:
- Build PyInstaller bundles for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Create a GitHub Release with download links
- The release appears under "Releases" in your repository

You can download the bundle directly from the Release page.

## Required Workflow

- Always create a new feature branch before making changes.
  - Use conventional branch names: `feat/feature-name`, `fix/bug-name`, `docs/documentation-name`
  - Example: `feat/ci-cd-setup`, `fix/import-error`, `docs/readme-update`
- Run linting and tests locally before pushing (see CI/CD Pipeline section)
- When the work is complete, create a pull request to `main`
- In the pull request description, include an executive summary of:
	- what was changed,
	- why it was changed,
	- the result or validation outcome.
- Prefer small, focused changes over broad refactors.
- Preserve existing project conventions unless the task explicitly asks for a change.

## Code Quality
- Follow standard Python coding conventions.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Always use snake case for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.
- Write modular, reusable code with clear interfaces.
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes.
- Write unit tests for all new functionality and ensure existing tests pass.
- Use type hints for all function signatures and class attributes.
- Use defensive programming practices, especially when handling external data or executing trades.
- Prefer shorter, atomic functions.

## Testing
- Use `uv run pytest tests` for running tests.
- Place all tests in the `tests/` directory.
- When creating tests, mirror the folder structure of `src` in the `tests` folder for better organization and maintainability.
- For every new feature (excluding the UI), create unit tests that cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error handling.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical logic.
- Test file naming convention: `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`

## Pull request template

```
### Summary
<!-- Provide a brief summary of the changes made in this pull request. -->
### Motivation
<!-- Explain the motivation behind these changes. Why were they necessary? -->
### Implementation
<!-- Describe the implementation details. What was changed and how? -->
### Validation
<!-- Describe how you validated the changes. What tests were run and what were the results? -->
### Additional Notes
<!-- Include any additional information or context that may be relevant to reviewers. -->
```

## Explicit boundaries
Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive information to the repository.
Use environment variables or secure vaults for managing sensitive data.
Always review code for security implications, especially when handling external data or executing trades.
Don't suggest `pip install` commands in code snippets. Use `uv` for dependency management and virtual environments.
Before adding a new dependency, consider if it is necessary (eg. there is an alternative already in the dependencies) and if there are lighter alternatives. Always prefer standard library solutions whenever reasonable.
