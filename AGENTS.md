# AGENTS.md

## Project overview
RedactAI is a locally running desktop application, which automatically detects and applies redactions to documents (images for now).

## Preferred language version and development tools
Python 3.14
Use `uv` for dependency management and virtual environments.
Use `black` for code formatting.
Use `flake8` for linting.

## How to set up the development environment
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
2. Install dependencies and create the virtual environment:
```bash
uv sync
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
uv shell
```

After development, you can run tests and linting with:
```bash
uv run pytest
uv run flake8 src tests
uv run black --check src tests
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Running checks locally before pushing

Before pushing your branch, run the same checks that CI will run:

```bash
# Lint and format
uv run flake8 src test
uv run black src test
uv run isort src test

# Run tests
uv run pytest test
```

### Creating a pull request

1. Push your feature branch to GitHub
2. Create a PR to `main`
3. Wait for the CI workflow to complete (usually 2–3 minutes)
4. If checks pass, you're good to merge
5. If checks fail, fix the issues locally and push again

### Creating a release

When you're ready to release a version:

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and everything is committed
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a version tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The CI/CD system will automatically:
- Build PyInstaller bundles for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Create a GitHub Release with download links
- Tag appears under "Releases" in your repository

You can download the bundle directly from the Release page.

## Required Workflow

- Always create a new branch before making changes.
- When the work is complete, create a merge request.
- In the merge request description, include an executive summary of:
	- what was changed,
	- why it was changed,
	- the result or validation outcome.
- Prefer small, focused changes over broad refactors.
- Preserve existing project conventions unless the task explicitly asks for a change.

## Code Quality
- Follow stardard Python coding conventions.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Always use snake case for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.
- Write modular, reusable code with clear interfaces.
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes.
- Write unit tests for all new functionality and ensure existing tests pass.
- Use type hints for all function signatures and class attributes.
- Use defensive programming practices, especially when handling external data or executing trades.
- Prefer shorter, atomic functions.

## Testing
- Use `uv run pytest` for running tests.
- When creating tests, mirror the folder structure of `src` in the `tests` folder for better organization and maintainability.
- For every new feature (exluding the UI), create unit tests that cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error handling.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical logic.

## Pull request template

"""
### Summary
<!-- Provide a brief summary of the changes made in this pull request. -->
### Motivation
<!-- Explain the motivation behind these changes. Why were they necessary? -->
### Implementation
<!-- Describe the implementation details. What was changed and how? -->
### Validation
<!-- Describe how you validated the changes. What tests were run and what were the results? -->
### Additional Notes
<!-- Include any additional information or context that may be relevant to reviewers. -->
"""

## Explicit boundaries
Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive information to the repository.
Use environment variables or secure vaults for managing sensitive data.
Always review code for security implications, especially when handling external data or executing trades.
Don't suggest `pip install` commands in code snippets. Use `uv` for dependency management and virtual environments.
Before adding a new dependency, consider if it is necessary (eg. there is an alternative already in the dependencies) and if there are lighter alternatives. Always prefer standard library solutions whenever reasonable.
